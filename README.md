OSRA (Orphan Sponsorship & Relief Association) is a non-profit organization
registered in the UK. Its aim is to sponsor orphans in Syria and to ensure basic
life and education requirements for Syrian children.

This project is the web application that stores and manages data used by OSRA.
These include records of the organization's partners in Syria, of the orphans
supported by the organization, as well as of the sponsors who make donations
towards this cause. The application also keeps track of sponsorship links formed
between sponsors and individual orphans.

This application is being built and maintained by a distributed team of
volunteer web developers. The project is proud to be a part of
[Agile Ventures](http://www.agileventures.org/) - a UK-registered non-profit
whose goal is to promote crowdsourced learning through creation of socially
beneficial web applications. The OSRA project's home page can be found at

We welcome all contributions. Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.
