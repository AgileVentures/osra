OSRA (Orphan Sponsorship & Relief Association) is a non-profit organization registered in the UK. Its aim is to sponsor orphans in Syria and to ensure basic life and education requirements for Syrian children.

This project's objective is to build an application that will store and manage data used by OSRA. These include records of the organization's partners in Syria, of the orphans supported by the organization, as well as of the sponsors who make donations towards this cause. The application also keeps track of sponsorship links formed between sponsors and individual orphans. Our long-term plans include creating a public-facing website through which new sponsors can join the organization and existing sponsors can make donations and receive updates about the orphans they support.

This application is being built by a distributed team of volunteer web developers. The project is proud to be a part of [Agile Ventures](http://www.agileventures.org/) - a UK-registered non-profit whose goal is to promote crowdsourced learning through creation of socially beneficial web applications. The OSRA project's home page can be found at [http://www.agileventures.org/projects/osra-support-system](http://www.agileventures.org/projects/osra-support-system).

In our development process, we follow Agile methods by continuously interacting with the client (the OSRA organization) to determine ongoing priorities and to review and accept the application's features as they are completed. We work in 2-week sprints and hold daily scrums at 20:00UTC, as well as weekly client meetings and fortnightly sprint planning meetings and retrospectives. We use [JIRA](https://osraav.atlassian.net/) as our project tracker and Semaphore as our continuous integration provider.

We welcome all contributions. Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

_Update Dec. 28, 2014: **The first phase of development is now complete and has been delivered to the client. The application is now live!**_
